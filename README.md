# ex3-dice-tricks
This plots the successes and standard deviation for various common dice tricks in Exalted 3rd Edition.

See this in action at https://colin-fredericks.github.io/ex3-dice-tricks/

This version currently uses jqplot. It's not as fast as I'd like it to be (there can be noticeable delays when using the success slider on older machines), so eventually I might like to move to d3, but it's not a priority.
